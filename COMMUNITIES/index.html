                    CS is the Computer Society of IEEE BVCOE and it deals with the practice and application of computer
                    science and technology be it hardware or software. The chapter has also evolved with the rest of the
                    world, thus a lot of the members research new aspects related to computer sciences like big data,
                    cloud storage, artificial intelligence. The chapter encourages curious minds to learn and look
                    towards a more practical future which can make them industry ready. The chapter also organises
                    various hackathons and workshops to lead the budding engineers and lets them experience an actual
                    working environment.

                    IEEE’s robotics and automation society was founded in 2014 by Shivam Bharadwaj. The main aim of RAS
                    is to focus on awareness and development of technical skills in the field of Robotics and automation
                    via theoretical knowledge and practical applications. Over the years, it has organized several
                    competitions like Robo Soccor, Robotic Guardians of the Galaxy, Robotic Mazes, Arcades, Robo Rugby,
                    etc. which were shown to have great acceptance as well as ample participation. RAS has also managed
                    to pique the interest of many of the students to further pursue the field of robotics in higher
                    studies as well as innovate ideas and study in depth at the top universities in the world such as
                    New York University. The society has also carved students who were winning faces in several national
                    and international competitions like eYantra and Celestini.

                    The IEEE Student Branch of Bharati Vidyapeeth’s College of Engineering got the approval for starting
                    the women in engineering student branch affinity group on 21st June 2007.
                    IEEE BVCOE women in the engineering branch as the name suggests aims towards piquing the interests of
                    girls in the field of engineering and science and to increase networking among young women who are
                    studying engineering. Also, to establish contacts with prominent women in academia and industry who
                    are interested in guiding girls in engineering. Thus encouraging women from all over the world to
                    become professional engineers and scientists.
                    The goal is to facilitate the recruitment and retention of women in technical disciplines globally.
                    We envision a vibrant community of IEEE women and men collectively using their diverse talents to
                    innovate for the benefit of humanity.
